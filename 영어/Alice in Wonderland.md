## Alice in Wonderland - 이상한 나라의 앨리스

Once there was a little girl named Alice. - 옛날에 앨리스라는 어린 소녀가 있었습니다.

She liked to play and have fun all the time. - 그녀는 항상 놀고 즐기는 것을 좋아했습니다.

One day she went to pick some flowers with her sister. - 어느 날 그녀는 여동생과 함께 꽃을 따러 갔습니다.

While she was picking flowers, she saw a white rabbit. - 그녀가 꽃을 따는 중에 하얀 토끼를 봤습니다.

The rabbit was wearing clothes. - 토끼는 옷을 입고 있었습니다.

It had on a red vest. - 빨간 조끼를 입고 있었습니다.

Then the rabbit said, "Oh, I'm late!", as he looked at his watch and ran away. - 토끼는 "오, 늦었어!" 하고 시계를 보더니 도망갔습니다.

Alice was curious about the white rabbit. - 앨리스는 흰 토끼가 궁금했습니다.

She had never seen a talking rabbit wearing a vest before so she ran after it. - 그녀는 조끼를 입은 토끼가 말하는 것을 본 적이 없기 때문에 쫒아갔습니다.

The rabbit ran and jumped into a large hole. - 토끼는 달려가 큰 구멍으로 뛰어들었습니다.

Alice also jumped into the large hole. - 앨리스 또한 큰 구멍으로 뛰어들어갔습니다.

She fell for a long time. - 그녀는 긴 시간동안 떨어졌습니다.

While she was falling, she saw many kinds of food. - 그녀가 떨어지는 동안, 많은 음식들을 봤습니다.

She saw jams, cakes, and many other sweets on the wall. - 그녀는 벽에 잼, 케이크 및 기타 많은 과자를 봤습니다.

Then she landed with a loud thud. - 그 떄 그녀는 큰 소리와 함께 착지했습니다.

Alice was in a large room. - 앨리스는 큰 방에 있었습니다.

There were many small doors on the wall in front of her. - 그녀 앞의 벽에 작은 문들이 많이 있었습니다.

She tried to open all of the doors one by one, but none of them opened. - 그녀는 모든 문을 하나씩 열려고 했지만 어느 것도 열리지 않았습니다.

They were all locked. - 전부 잠겨있었습니다.

Alice looked around the room. - 앨리스는 방을 둘러봤습니다.

She saw a large table in the center. - 그녀는 가운데에 큰 테이블을 봤습니다.

There was a gold key on the table. - 테이블에는 금 열쇠가 있었습니다.

She took the key and found a door that was beautiful. 그녀는 열쇠를 가지고 아름다운 문을 찾았습니다.

She put the key through the keyhole and it fit perfectly. - 그녀는 열쇠구멍에 열쇠를 넣었고 그것은 완벽하게 맞았습니다.

She opened the door and behind it was a long tunnel. - 그녀가 문을 열자 뒤에 긴 터널이 있었습니다.

The tunnel was to small for Alice to fit through. - 터널은 앨리스가 통과하기에는 너무 작았습니다.

At the end of the tunnel, Alice saw a beautiful garden. - 터널의 끝에서 앨리스는 아름다운 정원을 봤습니다.

She was too big to fit through the door, so she went back to the table where she had found the gold key. - 그녀는 문을 통과하기에 너무 컸기 때문에 금 열쇠를 찾았던 책상으로 돌아갔습니다.

"I wish I was smaller so I could visit that beautiful garden" she thought to herself. - "내가 좀 더 작았더라면 저 아름다운 정원을 방문할 수 있었을 텐데" 라고 그녀는 생각했습니다.

This time on the same table there was a bottle with a label that read "Drink me." Alice was curious. - 이번에는 같은 테이블 위에 "날 마셔"라고 적힌 라벨이 붙은 병이 있었습니다. 앨리스는 궁금했어요.

She drank from the bottle. - 그녀는 병에 든 것을 마셨습니다.

The juice in the bottle tasted delicious. - 병 안에 있던 쥬스는 맛있었습니다.

All of a sudden, she started to change. - 갑자기 그녀는 변하기 시작했습니다.

"I'm getting smaller!" she shouted. - "내가 점점 작아져!" 그녀는 소리쳤습니다.

She got smaller and smaller until finally she was small enough to fit through the door to get to the beautiful garden. - 그녀는 점점 더 작아져서 마침내 문을 통과해 아름다운 정원에 갈 수 있을 만큼 작아졌습니다.

When she got to the garden she saw the white rabbit again.

The rabbit had white gloves on and was holding a fan.

He said, "If I make the Duchess wait, she will be angry!" Alice asked the white rabbit a question, but he did not hear her.

He looked at Alice and dropped the gloves and the fan he was holding.

Alice picked up the fan and the gloves lying on the ground.

"I don't want to stay here all alone" she said out loud to herslef.

She started to cry.

The rabbit started to feel sad too.

He had made Alice cry.

He said to her, "Well, Mary-Jane, what are you doing here? Bring me my fan and gloves now!" Alice was confused, because the rabbit had called her Mary-Jane.

As Alice came near the white rabbit, she heard someone say, "Be careful, you are splashing red paint on my face!" She colud not believe her eyes.

She saw three gardeners painting white roses red.

"It is not my fault" replied the first gradener.

"The second gardener pushed me!"

"Excuse me, gentlemen, why are you painting these roses red?" Alice asked them.

"We should have planted red roses, but we planted white roses by mistake. The Queen will be anry when she find out" he answered.

All of a sudden the first gardener shouted, "The Queen! The Queen!" and all three gardeners laid flat on the ground.

The Queen came and walked towards Alice.

She asked in a scary tone of voice, "Who is this little girl?"

"My name is Alice, Your Majesty" answered Alice politely.

"And who are they?" asked the Queen, pointing at the three gardeners.

Alice replied, "How should I know? They have nothing to do with me."

The Queen did not like the way Alice answered her question.

She shouted, "Off with her head!" The king was by the Queen's side.

He said to his wife, "Remeber, my dear, she's only a child."

Suddenly, Alice began to grow bigger and bigger until she graw back to her normal size.

The Queen screamed once more, "Off with her head!" The Queen was very angry, She wnated Alice captured.

"I am leaving this strange place and there is nothing you can do about it. I am not one of your people, you can control" said Alice.

She was not afraid of the Queen or the gardeners.

Alice was very brave.

The gardeners came together and tried to take Alice away.

She tried to shake them off.

They grabbed her arms and legs.

She was crying out for them to stop.

Then she realized she was lying on her sister's lap.

"Alice, wake up, you are having a bad dream. You have been asleep for a long time!" said her sister.

"I had the strangest dream" said Alice.

She shared the dream with her sister.

When she was done telling her sister about the dream, Alice's sister laughed and said, "You had such an interesting dream. I am hungry now. Let's go get some snacks to eat."

"Oh, I am late. If I make the duchess wait, she will be angry!" said Alice.

She laughed at herself.

That was the smae thing the rabbit had said to her.
