## Cool Cat!

I wonder What my cat does... when I am at school all day

I wonder What my cat does when I'm at school, I bet it is something really cool.

Does he pound mix, and bake, bread, pastry, or a cake?

Does he cut, thread, or knit, a beautiful new outfit?

Does he splash paint on it all, pretty colours for the wall?

Does he sing, hum, or play, does he get carried away?

Does he conjure real quick, a fun magic trick?

Does he tend, feed, or sow, a flower to grow?

Does he catch a ball on a whim, or does it fall and catch him?

Does he help Mum with the chores, or does he find that just bores?

Does he hit, drive, and swing, or is golf not his thing?

Does he talk on his phone, so he's never alone?

Does he fight fires, save lives, so every child, woman, man, thrives?

Does he chill to some tunes, in one of his favourite rooms?

or does he simply meander and think, with a nice coffee to drink?

Whatever my cat does, I'm sure he does it well, since he is awesome, can't you tell.
